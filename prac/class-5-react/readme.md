why react? 
easier to do dom manipulation using libraries  
react is just easier way of html/css/js  
browser just understands html/css/js  
jquery was one library in js, but it is still difficult to create DOM, no one uses it now  
eventually vue/react is used to do frontends.  
open source  
lets create a counter button
