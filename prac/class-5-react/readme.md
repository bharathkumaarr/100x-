why react? 
easier to do dom manipulation using libraries  
react is just easier way of html/css/js  
browser just understands html/css/js  
jquery was one library in js, but it is still difficult to create DOM, no one uses it now  
eventually vue/react is used to do frontends.  
open source  
lets create a counter button  
  
  
now this is shit, and too much ot write, so therefore react.  
  
  
to create a react app, you need  
componets,  
state,  
re-rendering.  
  
  
creators of frontend frameworks found out that all websites can be devided into two main things: state and components.  
  
state: the dynamic things of the website/app is state. Ex: the counter value inside the button here was state.  
  
example contd. :  
{  
count: 1  
 }  
  
  
another example: linkedIn navbar. waht are the things that are changing in that top bar?  home: 0, mynetwork: 99+, notificaitons: 10, ...  
  
  
components: it is like a html snippet(for now) that changes given the state. it is reusable and dynamic. [here mynetowrk, notifications, home.. ] are some components. 
  
  
  
re-rendering: a state change triggers the re-render. it just shows the actual DOM is being manipulated when the state changes.  
  
  
we usually defiine our componets once,  
and then just keep changing the state of our app,  
react takes care of re-rendering our app.  
  
  
let's create the same app using react.  
  
  
this shit is too much  
  
initialisation of state,button render, re-rendering of state.  
  
  
in real world all the websites(almost) are dynamic.   
  
  
  
now let's write it all in react:
